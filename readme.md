#Assignment #1a - Fibonacci Sequence using Iteration
Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.

#Assignment #1b - Fibonacci Sequence using Recursion
Another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.

#Assignment #2
Build a function "mergeSort" that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
